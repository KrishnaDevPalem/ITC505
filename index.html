  <h2>Technical Addendum</h2>
  <p>The Lights Out Game project was meticulously crafted with an emphasis on technical considerations. The following outlines the technical thought process and methods employed during development:</p>
  
  <h3>Technical Architecture:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> The game leverages JavaScript for dynamic manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the state of each cell based on user interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Event listeners are employed to detect user clicks, triggering the appropriate functions to handle game logic and update the display.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Optimization Techniques:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Efficient Algorithms:</strong> The algorithm for determining the state changes of neighboring cells was optimized to ensure fast and responsive gameplay.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS styling incorporates media queries to create a responsive layout, ensuring an optimal user experience across various screen sizes and devices.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This project serves as a technical showcase, demonstrating the integration of advanced JavaScript functionality and optimization techniques to deliver a seamless and performant Lights Out Game. Scroll down to explore the technical intricacies!</p>
