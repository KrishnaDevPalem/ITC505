  <h2>Project Addendum</h2>
  <p>This Lights Out Game was developed with careful consideration of user interaction and game dynamics. The following describes the thought process and methods used in the development:</p>
  
  <h3>Thought Process:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> The main goal was to create an engaging user experience. Clicking on cells to toggle lights on or off provides a simple yet interactive gameplay.</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge Factor:</strong> The difficulty was incorporated by designing the game to require users to strategically turn off all the lights. This adds a level of challenge and encourages critical thinking.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Methods Used:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> The HTML structure is designed to provide a clear and organized layout for the game, including a header, game container, and controls.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> The styles.css file is utilized for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design across various devices.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript Functionality:</strong> The game logic is implemented in the script.js file. It includes functions for resetting the game and handling user interactions to manipulate the lights.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This project aims to showcase a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an enjoyable and challenging game. Feel free to explore and enjoy the Lights Out Game!</p>
